Plant App UI clone coding

Using package

flutter_svg : https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg


Clone coding enabled me to learn import, basic framework composition, basic methods.
Besides, I learned how to do many settings in the ios simulator and the android studio
Next I will study Firebase and HTTP/JSON and then make my own app.
Thank you for Abu Anwar.
